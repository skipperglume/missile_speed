I use VLC app to convert different types of audio\video files to WAV format

These two scripts cut your input WAV file into pieces (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0lSpNtjPM8)
Saves these cuts into output path
Length can be defined by user
Example how to run the script

python3 Run_Manipulation.py --input "/mnt/c/summer_2022/input/2.wav" --output "/mnt/c/summer_2022/missile_frequency/output_sound" --length 4000
